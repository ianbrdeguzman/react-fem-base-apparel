## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly
